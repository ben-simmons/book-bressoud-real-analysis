## Synopsis

*This course of analysis is radical; it returns to the roots of the subject. It is not a history of analysis.
It is rather an attempt to follow the injunction of Henri Poincar√© to let history inform pedagogy. It is designed
to be a first encounter with real analysis, laying out its context and motivation in terms of the transition
from power series to those that are less predictable, especially Fourier series, and marking some of the traps
into which even great mathematicians have fallen.* - Preface, pg. ix
